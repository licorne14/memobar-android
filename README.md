# MemoBar

### Open To-Dos
- update all the libraries etc.

  - right now manual approval in settings is required
- ~~fix not being able to check the box at the very bottom cause it's covered by the FAB~~
- add support for dynamic design
  - it does already follow the system per default
- import / export backups?
